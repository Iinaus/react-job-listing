## About

This code is from the [React Crash Course 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0) tutorial on YouTube.

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and JSON-Server for a mock backend.

With this exercise, we practiced:
- Using React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Using React Router and its hooks (useParams, useNavigate)
- Using data loader
- Setting up JSON-Server and making API calls from the frontend

## Getting started

Instructions on how to set up and run the project. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Dev setup step-by-step

1. Install dependencies with command `npm install`
2. Run JSON Server on http://localhost:8000 with command `npm run server`
2. Run the frontend on http://localhost:3000 with command `npm run dev`
